## Preliminary Notes Documentation

- micronaut-beginner-reactive

- Create a rest api micronaut application that is reactive in native. The application will not have a real data store. It will have two services instead that mimic outside api calls and return data with delays in between elements. The application will be built with reactive programming techinques all the way up to the controller layer.
- The application will have two enities, Movie and Actor. The data services will provid a list of movies and a list of actors. The movies will have attributes (name, year, genre) as attributes and Actor will have name and birthdate as attributes. The application services will do queries and return various sets of data. For movies, we will query for all movie, all movies made after a year, all movies that are a certain genre. For actors, find all actors, older than a certain age.  The application will also add actors to a movie and send it back.
- The app will have some tests which will verify the functionality and demonstrate the reactive nature of it.
